                <p>Hello once again, assuming you read the other about me… ANYWAY I as you should know am Ryan, your wonderful website maker today or rather this website. I am currently in my Junior year of highschool as I have said before. I joined the Esports club for SSBU (Super Smash Bros. Ultimate) this year. I am currently a majority A student. I have been slacking on English and I really just hate Math this year yet I am still trying my best. I guess that isn’t entirely true of trying my best. At least, I don’t put my full effort forward unless I have an incentive or is for work (money is a powerful motivator.) But I still do put my best foot forward. I do what is required at the very least.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reading: I personally always enjoy a good fiction story. I however for some reason hate poetry, I do not know why.</li>
                    <li>Writing: I always enjoy writing fiction, specifically for my other hobby being Dungeons & Dragons. This is a very good creative outlet.</li>
                    <li>Candle Making: I just enjoy this one, no real reason.</li>
                    <li>Gaming: Again, like the last one, just something I do for fun.</li>
                    <li>Dungeons & Dragons: This is a very fun and creative experience, it gives me social interaction I desperately need. My social anxiety makes it hard.</li>
                    <li>Mug Making?: I like doing this but I have only really done it for commissions.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Problem Solving: This has been given from all the projects in school. I’ll say the engineering classes have helped me the most here, also science fair.</li>
                    <li>Leadership: All the group projects. I have also learned how to do the majority of the work because no one else will work. I hate group projects in schools.</li>
                    <li>Design Process: This is from both engineering and programming sides. I mean also a bit of the science side too from the science fair. But overall a good skill to have because it instills a knowledge of failure.</li>
                    <li>Use of Fanuc Robot</li>
                    <li>Use Of PLC</li>
                    <li>Use Of HTML/CSS</li>
                    <li>Wiring</li>
                    <li>Use of CAD</li>
