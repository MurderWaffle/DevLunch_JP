                <h3>Engineering Design</h3>
                <p>In this class we learned the steps to the engineering design process and CAD.
                     We used the website <a target="_blank" href="https://cad.onshape.com">Onshape</a> 
                     for CADing, it is an easy website and good for beginners. This is all we worked on the freshman year.</p>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>We learned basic Java programming, and we used Eclipse IDE to program. I do not have any of my code from that year nor projects.</p>

                <h3>AC/DC</h3>
                <p>We learned about AC and DC circuits and how to wire them. I know we did a couple projects on <a target="_blank" href="https://cad.onshape.com">Onshape</a> but I do not believe we did any wiring projects other than the labs.</p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>I genuinely don't remember anything of what I learned this year.</p>

                <h3>Industrial Robotics and Robotics</h3>
                <p>The first semester we were working with the FANUC robots, we did several projects. Sadly I do not have any pictures or videos for them. I have been fully certified in the state of Ohio to use the FANUC robots.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Part 2</h3>
                <p>In the second semester we work with PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller), I do not have any of this code currently. However this was a very fun experience and I am also certified to use PLCs</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Visual Programming</h3>
                <p>This is my language class but also my pathway. Thank you programming for being a language, I couldn’t last another second in spanish. Jokes aside, I have really enjoyed this class. I have another major project other than this website and you can see images below.</p>

                <h3>Engineering</h3>
                <p>The main skills I have learned and are important in my day to day life is wiring and CAD. Wiring is always good to know, you can fix almost anything yourself. Cad is good to know so you can make almost anything witht a 3d printer. </p>
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>The main skill is well programming. This alows me to make any program I want, for example I need to make a website for a personal website I can do that without paying someone else.</p>
